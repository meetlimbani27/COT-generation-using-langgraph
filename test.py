acids, while nucleases catalyze the hydrolysis of the phosphoester bonds in DNA and RNA. 
Careful control of the activities of these enzymes is required to ensure that they act only 
on appropriate target molecules at appropriate times. 

Many Metabolic Reactions Involve Group Transfer
Many of the enzymic reactions responsible for synthesis and breakdown of biomolecules 
involve the transfer of a chemical group G from a donor D to an acceptor A to form an 
acceptor group complex, Aâ€”G: The hydrolysis and phosphorolysis of glycogen, for example, 
involve the transfer of glucosyl groups to water or to orthophosphate. 

The equilibrium constant for the hydrolysis of covalent bonds strongly favors the formation 
of split products. Conversely, in many cases the group transfer reactions responsible for 
the biosynthesis of macromolecules involve the thermodynamically unfavored formation of 
covalent bonds. Enzyme catalysts play a critical role in surmounting these barriers by 
virtue of their capacity to
